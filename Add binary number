#Add binary numbers
#finding the sum of two binary numbers is done
binary1 = input("Enter the first binary number: ")
binary2 = input("Enter the second binary number: ")

num1 = int(binary1, 2)
num2 = int(binary2, 2)

sum_binary = bin(num1 + num2)[2:]

print(f"The sum of {binary1} and {binary2} is: {sum_binary}")

OUTPUT:
Enter the first binary number: 1010
Enter the second binary number: 1111
The sum of 1010 and 1111 is: 11001
